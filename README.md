# DeskTidy

DeskTidy is a simple, user-friendly desktop application designed to help you organize your cluttered folders. With just a few clicks, you can categorize and move files from any specified folder (like your Desktop or Downloads folder) into organized subfolders based on file types. DeskTidy makes it easy for non-technical users to keep their files organized without the need to navigate complex file management tasks manually.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use GUI**: A straightforward graphical interface allows users to select folders and specify custom file extensions for organization.
